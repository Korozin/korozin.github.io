# The Modding Hub

This is essentially a website to house every modding need for Minecraft: Wii U edition and more. It includes various tools and codes I have gathered for anyone to use and I plan to add much more in the future. 

# Redirect Feature

In addition to having many tools to use the page will also automatically redirect you to the Homebrew launcher side if it detects you accessed the site on a Wii U
However if you access it on another device such as your computer it will direct you to the Modding Hub! 

# What it includes so far

So far the site contains various ranges of mods from Custom Skins, Custom Maps, Custom Battle Packs, Texutre Packs, GUIs (AKA Media.ARC's" it also includes
a variety of tools for coding the game such as JGecko U and MANY codelists to use. I have also included a NBT Table generator to make your own mod menus without
needing to know how to make the code yourself (Credit JackWiiU12345 for that tool) There is also a Pixel Art generation tool written in C# to copy and paste
pixel art into your worlds. Not only that, the site also included means in which to NUS mod which esentially means downloading files from Nintendo's NUS Servers
to install onto your console (TLDR free games and DLC) But if you're just getting started I've also included both a general homebrew package, and a guide to the
newest CFW method, Tiramisu, along with the WUP installer files for the Homebrew Channel App.

If you have any requests on what to add open an issue requesting as such.
